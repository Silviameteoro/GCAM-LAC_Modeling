Notes:

1 - The final scenarios naming used in the manuscript differs from what was used originally to perform the GCAM simulations. For this reason, the scenario names listed in the .csv files (model outputs) differ from the ones adopted in the manuscript.

2 - "CI" refers to the simulations that account for climate impacts. "NoCI" refers to the simulations that neglect climate impacts on renewables.

3 - For each scenario, there are three distinct simulations. Each of them is based on GCAM inputs produced from climate-impact data from a different general circulation model (GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES or IPSL-CM5A-LR) as mentioned in the manuscript.
