This repository contains input files used in the GCAM-LAC model (a research branch of the Global Change Analysis Model ─ GCAM) developed specifically for the analysis reported in the manuscript entitled “Power sector investment implications of climate impacts on renewable resources in Latin America and the Caribbean”, currently under review in Nature Communications. This repository also contains all model outputs from GCAM, which were analyzed in the study. The source code of the GCAM-LAC version used in this study is available at https://github.com/Silviameteoro/gcam-core/tree/twild/feature/LAC-LFS.
